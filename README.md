# SwimmingPool
Project from a computer graphics course. Constructs a swimming pool scene from from primitive drawing operations using triangles and the OpenGl fixed function pipeline.
The F1-F3 buttons toggle the red, green, and blue components of the light source. The F4 button toggles the texture of the water, and the F5 button toggles the tile texture on the walls.
The camera position can be moved with the up and down arrow keys and rotated with the mouse.

The project should build in Visual Studio as long as the target architecture is x86 not x64, and the OpenGL headers and glut are installed on your system.
